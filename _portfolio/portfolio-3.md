**MIO**, the search engine, is targeted at users who have a specific movie search purpose or just want to find a proper movie with some filtering information. For users who could remember the title of the film, MIO could return the proper film quickly. On the other hand, if users just have an actor's name or a movie category, MIO could return satisfactory searching results with the ranking of film scores, with which users could have some ideas and advice for movie choice.

At the same time, MIO provides well-designed user interfaces as well as fluent interaction experience, sparing no efforts to make users comfortable.
