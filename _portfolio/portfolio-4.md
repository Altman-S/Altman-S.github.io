**XV6** is an operating system built on **RISC-V** architecture.

New features are implemented in a series of lab improvments, including a few new system calls, separate kernel page for each process, lazy allocation, copy-on-write, mmap, user-level threading, fined-grained memory allocator and cache block, file system and a basic network driver.
